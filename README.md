A simple, yet powerful budgeting app. Create as many budgets as you like for the changing months, seasons and life events, and get insights into your spending.

Budgify was created as my third milestone project for the Code Institutes Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was primarily crafted with a focus on aesthetics and accessibility. Following the contemporary trend observed in web apps, simplicity and minimalism guided the design approach. A notable source of design inspiration for this application was Calendly, known for its clean and uncomplicated design.

Given these considerations, I opted for a white background and mainly utilised colours from the main Bootstrap colour palette. This choice not only aligns with the minimalist design trend but also ensures ease of implementation in various sections by simply applying specific classes such as `primary`, `success`, or `danger`.

-   ##### Colours Used
    - Text colour 1 - `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.65)`
    - Text colour 2 - `#0d6efd`
    - Background colour - `#ffffff`
    - Button colour 1 - `#0d6efd` / Bootstrap `primary` class
    - Button colour 2 - `#198754` / Bootstrap `success` class
    - Button colour 3 - `#dc3545` / Bootstrap `danger` class
    - Button text colour - `#ffffff`
    - Budget card colour - `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45)`

#### Colour Accessibility
			
To ensure the colours chosen met the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines as minimum and AAA guidelines where possible I used Coolors Contrast Checker which can be found [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-ffffff).

For further information on these guidelines, you can visit the following link. [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (w3.org)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

#### Typography
The main considerations for the font were...

 - ##### Fallback Font

    For my fallback font I have opted for the Arial font, part of the sans-serif family. It is the most widely used font for both online and printed media. Arial is said to be one of the safest web fonts, and is available on all major operating systems.
