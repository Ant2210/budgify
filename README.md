#### Typography
The main considerations for the font were...

 - ##### Fallback Font

    For my fallback font I have opted for the Arial font, part of the sans-serif family. It is the most widely used font for both online and printed media. Arial is said to be one of the safest web fonts, and is available on all major operating systems.
